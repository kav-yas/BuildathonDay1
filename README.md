SalesReportGenerator
SalesReportGenerator is a Java program designed to generate a detailed sales report for a store. The program takes user input for sales data across multiple products and calculates key information, including:

Total Sales: The sum of sales for all products.
Average Sales: The average sales figure across all products.
Highest-Selling Product: The product with the highest sales.
The report generation is implemented using both a for loop and nested if conditions. The program ensures robust error handling to prevent crashes due to invalid inputs, such as negative sales values or non-numeric entries.
